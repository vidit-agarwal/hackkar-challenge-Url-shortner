# Task 2: Build an API for a URL shortener

## Description

To complete this task, I've  written a  handler code in the file `src/api.js`. The file includes documentation on the requirements.

Do not modify `package.json` or introduce additional modules. Only the Node standard library should be used to complete this task.

I've also included a small test suite to check whether the code you've written works as expected.

## Execution

To run the API on port 3000, use the start script:

    $ npm run start

Now, load up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. This task includes code that scaffolds the required routes. You just need to get the API routes working as expected.

## Testing

To execute all tests, use the tests script:

    $ npm run test
